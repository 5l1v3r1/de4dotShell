De4dotShell
===========

Introduction
------------

De4dotShell is a small utility (inspired by idea of de4dotUI by Yashar Mamoudnida) created in C#, which provides a small and easy to use GUI for de4dot, where you can invoke de4dot from context menu, ad parameters/switches directly from GUI interface and watch it work. Thing are done out-of-the-box.

This is a small update of my old project, which is abandoned for a while due to my busy work in real life.
Someone reported that this works fine in Windows 7, but not in 8/8.1 and Windwos 10. So here is the fix for that issues.

Changelog:
----------

**Version 0.1b**
> - UPdate compability to work with Windows 8/8.1 and Windows 10
> - Tidy up code
> - Add new Icon
> - Change font and color for the output Richtextbox
> - Update Readme.md file

**Version 0.1**
> - Initial Release

Disclaimer
----------
This project is just a hobby project, so except bugs. The source is simple and open, so you can do whatever you want.
